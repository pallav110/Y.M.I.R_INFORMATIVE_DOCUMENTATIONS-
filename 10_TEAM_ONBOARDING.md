# Python Code Standards
# =====================

# 1. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
# 2. Use type hints for function parameters and return values
# 3. Write comprehensive docstrings

def detect_emotion(face_image: np.ndarray, confidence_threshold: float = 0.7) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Detect emotion from facial image using ensemble model approach.
    
    Args:
        face_image: Normalized face image as numpy array (48x48 grayscale)
        confidence_threshold: Minimum confidence score for emotion prediction
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with emotion labels as keys and confidence scores as values
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If face_image is invalid or empty
        
    Example:
        >>> emotion_scores = detect_emotion(face_array)
        >>> print(emotion_scores)
        {'happiness': 0.85, 'neutral': 0.12, 'surprise': 0.03}
    """
    if face_image is None or face_image.size == 0:
        raise ValueError("Face image cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation with error handling
    try:
        predictions = self.model.predict(face_image)
        return self.process_predictions(predictions, confidence_threshold)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Emotion detection failed: {e}")
        return {'neutral': 1.0}  # Safe fallback

# 4. Comprehensive error handling and logging
# 5. Unit tests for all functions
# 6. Performance optimization comments
```

**JavaScript Code Standards**

```javascript
// JavaScript/Frontend Standards
// =============================

// 1. Use ES6+ features consistently
// 2. Implement proper error handling
// 3. Comment complex emotion processing logic

/**
 * Process real-time emotion data from camera feed
 * @param {Object} emotionData - Raw emotion detection results
 * @param {number} smoothingFactor - Temporal smoothing coefficient (0-1)
 * @returns {Object} Processed emotion state with confidence scores
 */
const processEmotionData = async (emotionData, smoothingFactor = 0.3) => {
    try {
        // Validate input data
        if (!emotionData || typeof emotionData !== 'object') {
            throw new Error('Invalid emotion data provided');
        }
        
        // Apply temporal smoothing for stable UI updates
        const smoothedEmotion = await applyTemporalSmoothing(
            emotionData, 
            smoothingFactor
        );
        
        // Update UI with smooth emotion transitions
        await updateEmotionUI(smoothedEmotion);
        
        return smoothedEmotion;
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Emotion processing error:', error);
        // Graceful degradation
        return getDefaultEmotionState();
    }
};

// 4. Async/await for cleaner asynchronous code
// 5. Consistent naming conventions
// 6. Performance monitoring for real-time features
```
